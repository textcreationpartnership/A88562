            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Cities, eſpecially <hi>Edenbrough,</hi> the chiefe Citie of that Kingdome, with the Plague of Peſtilence ſo fearefully, as there is no living there, nor any Commerce, Trade, nor exchange of Money, which encreaſes our difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to maintaine a Warre, &amp; a Parliament is indicted by <hi>Montroſſe,</hi> to eſtabliſh all theſe iniquities by a Law.</p>
            <p>In this our extremitie, we were forced to have our recourſe to our Armies in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> to crave their aid; and for that end I am ſent hither to the Honourable Houſes of Parliament, to repreſent to them and this Honourable Meeting the neceſſitie of calling our Armie, for the reliefe and ſafetie of their Native Countrey, and that the partie who was neereſt them, under the conduct of Lieutenant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>David Leſly,</hi> might with all poſſible ſpeed march into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to whom the Committee did earneſtly write for that effect: this was the readieſt remedie which did fall within the compaſſe of their preſent conſideration; they deſire, and are confident, to finde the Honourable Houſes approbation thereof, there being no hope of aſſiſtance from our Armie in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

remember the ſolemne League and Covenant, the Treatie, and the Declarations of both Kingdomes, which are the ſtrongeſt bonds betwixt God and man, and betwixt man and man, and Nation and Nation, before the world: no man hath true zeale to Religion, that will ſhrinke for ſuch adverſitie and oppoſition, as hath beene ordinarie in the like worke, and hath beene obvious to us ſince our firſt undertaking, but hath been alwayes overcome by the aſſiſtance of God: no man hath prudence, will hope for a powerfull and proſperous Warre, or any firme or true peace, but in the conjunction of both Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>How great then would the ſinne and ſhame be, if either Nation, againſt ſo manifold Obligations whereby we ſtand obliged before God and the world, ſhould deſert other in this Cauſe?</p>
